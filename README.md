## 🌅 Context

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations curriculum. It serves as an early JavaScript exercise to build foundational programming skills before moving on to more complex projects. The project focuses on implementing game logic, understanding function scope, and user interaction through the browser console.

## 🌱 Purpose and Use Case

**Purpose:** To practice core JavaScript fundamentals including functions, conditionals, loops, and random number generation while building a playable game.

**Use Case:** This is an educational project designed to teach beginners how to:

- Define and call functions
- Handle user input with `window.prompt()`
- Use conditional logic to evaluate game outcomes
- Maintain game state with variables
- Generate random selections
- Structure a simple turn-based game loop

The game can be played by opening `index.html` in a web browser, which will prompt the player for 5 rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer, displaying results in the browser console.
